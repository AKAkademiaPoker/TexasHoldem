TEXAS HOLD’EM RULES:
Texas Hold’em Poker is a community card game that can be played anywhere from 2-10 players.

One player acts as dealer. This position is called the button and 
it rotates clockwise after every hand.

The two players to the left of the dealer are called the small blind 
and the big blind, respectively.

These two positions require forced bets of a pre-determined amount 
and are the only players to put money in the pot before the cards are dealt 
(if no ante in place).

Every player then receives two cards face down. 
These are called “hole” cards.

Once all hole cards have been dealt, the first betting round begins 
with the player sitting immediately to the left of the big blind. 
This player can fold, call (match the amount of the big blind) or raise.

Betting then continues clockwise, with each player having the option to fold, 
call the amount of the highest bet before them, bet or raise.

When the first betting round is completed, three community 
cards are flipped face up on the table. This is called the flop.

The betting resumes, clockwise, with each player having the option to check 
(if no bet is in front of them), bet (or raise if a bet is before them), 
call or fold.

When the second round of betting is finished, 
a fourth community card is flipped face up on the table. 
This is called the turn.

The third round of betting commences with the first remaining player 
sitting to the left of the button.

When the third round of betting is over, a fifth community card is 
flipped face up on the table. This is called the river.

The fourth round of betting starts with the first remaining player 
seated to the left of the button. The betting continues to move clockwise.
